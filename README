A simple demo illustrating, among other things:
 - Akka Mist (dynamic actor routing, response redirects)
 - Facebook Graph API (authentication, friend data)
 - Google Maps API (geolocating friends)
 - WebGL (texture tweening, dynamic texture updates)
 - Webworkers (requesting friend data)

This is just quick iteration on the Akka sample gist I did showing how to use the Leeloo lib to authenticate
with your Facebook login.  It's really a total mash-up of existing code snippets and in particular the Webkit demo
which is dog slow (hence the friend count slider).  This was more of an exercise to explore the graph API a bit
and doesn't have much more in it than a few late-night hours and part of a sick day. 

Building
--------
Update Service.scala with your app & secret and hostname (you can actually use localhost for testing).
Get SBT 0.7.5 and build the project. For this one, I had Akka master branch built and published locally (see below)
Use 'dist' and created a deployable zip. Go deploy it.
Copy the fbgnn.jar to the deploy/ folder along with the oauth jars (2 of them) from the lib_managed/ folder.
Copy the akka.conf, microkernel-server.xml and logback.xml to the dist config/ folder.
Create a root/ folder in the distro and copy the files from the src/main/resources/ folder.

Getting Going
-------------
Point your latest and greatest browser (tested on Chrome 10, FoxB8 works but is really slow) here:

http://a.b.c.d:9998/index.html?user_id=...

and pass in your Facebook ID (the unique value not your name)


In a Nutshell
